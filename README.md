# GlobalWeatherHub üåç

A dynamic web application that provides real-time weather information for any location on Earth, built as part of an assignment to demonstrate REST API integration using Syncloop. Users can interact with a leaflet map to get detailed weather data for specific coordinates.

## Assignment Overview üìù

This project was created to fulfill the following requirements:
1. Create REST APIs on Syncloop
2. Develop a GUI to consume these APIs
3. Integrate Leaflet JavaScript Map
4. Implement functionality to:
   - Capture coordinates on map click
   - Fetch weather information using those coordinates

## Features üåü

- Integration with Syncloop REST API for weather data
- Interactive map interface using Leaflet.js
- Real-time weather data fetching
- Location search functionality
- Detailed weather information including:
  - Current temperature and conditions
  - Atmospheric conditions (humidity, wind, pressure)
  - Sun and moon information (sunrise, sunset)
  - Local time display
- Weather alerts for extreme conditions
- Responsive design with glass-morphism UI
- Coordinates display for clicked locations

  ## Screenshots üì∏
