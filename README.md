# GlobalWeatherHub üåç

A dynamic web application that provides real-time weather information for any location on Earth, built as part of an assignment to demonstrate REST API integration using Syncloop. Users can interact with a leaflet map to get detailed weather data for specific coordinates.

> ## Syncloop API Integration üîå

The Syncloop API, which provides the weather data for this application, is included in the repository. You can download the API package by clicking the link below:

[Download Syncloop API Package](https://github.com/coderiders22/GlobalWeatherHub/blob/5806618e5f236e42f4850e3f784cb797d4fc0b17/Syncloop%20Weather%20Api%20.zip)

Once downloaded, please extract the contents and follow the setup instructions provided in the package to integrate the API into the application.

### Syncloop API
- Custom REST API built on Syncloop
- Returns comprehensive weather data for specified coordinates
- Authentication and endpoints are pre-configured in the application

## Prerequisites üìã

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A modern web browser

> [!TIP]
> ## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coderiders22/GlobalWeatherHub.git
cd GlobalWeatherHub
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
npm install express cors path
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
node server.js
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
5. Add the token to your application**:
   In the project, find the following line of code in server.js file:

   ```javascript
   const BEARER_TOKEN = 'Replace existing token with your token generated through the platform';
   ```

   Replace `'Insert Bearer Token Here'` with the token you generated from Syncloop API Dashboard.

Once you have added your token, the application will authenticate API requests using that token.

That's it! The application is now running with all necessary configurations set up in the code.

### Local API Endpoints
#### GET `/Weather_Info`
- Parameters:
  - `lt`: Latitude
  - `ln`: Longitude
- Returns: Weather information from Syncloop API

#### GET `/`
